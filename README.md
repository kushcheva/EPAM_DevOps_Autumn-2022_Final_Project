# Final project CI/CD

Example of integration and delivery of the flask application by using the jenkins pipeline to production server. 

IT stack:

1. Python Flask framework.
2. GitHub as application source repository
3. Terraform
4. Docker and DockerHub
5. Jenkins as CI/CD
6. AWS EC2




## Installation

Create my simple project Python Flask web application fp_app.py  and running test to make sure with working code.

Ð¡reate 2 instances: my_server_dev and my_server_prod with configurations of security group, ssh key and opened ports by using Terraform.

## Deployment

Running on node my_server_dev Jenkins pipeline which create our Docker build and pushes it to Dockerhub registry. The sourse is Github. 

Then run container `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 kushcheva/fp_app`. Make sure there are no one previous containers and images on our machine. The latest image is pulling from Dockerhub.

If it is work properly we will deploy latest build by pulling from Dockerhub on my_server_prod and we use separated pipeline not to mix development  and production environments. The development pipeline will start by automatic trigger when the previous pipeline have done succesfully.
