IT stack:

1. Python Flask framework.
2. GitHub as application source repository
3. Terraform
4. Docker and DockerHub
5. Jenkins as CI/CD
6. AWS EC2




## Installation

Create a web application fp_app.py with Python Flask and run test to make sure that code works.

Using Terraform create 2 instances: my_server_dev and my_server_prod with configurations of security group, ssh key and opened ports.

## Deployment

Run Jenkins pipeline on node my_server_dev, which create our Docker build and push it to Docker hub registry. The application source is Github. 

Then run container `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 kushcheva/fp_app`. Make sure there are no previous containers and images on current machine. The latest image should be pulled from Dockerhub.

If it works properly we will deploy latest build by pulling from Dockerhub on my_server_prod. We use separated pipeline not to mix development and production environments. Deployment pipeline will start by automatic trigger after the previous pipeline will done successfully.

As a result we have a working web Flask application.
